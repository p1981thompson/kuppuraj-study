# K.Sengottuvel adjusted the script originally from R bloggers link "https://www.r-bloggers.com/power-and-sample-size-for-repeated-measures-anova-with-r/".

#Amendments: P.Thompson 16/01/2017 - adjusted the model error setup to correct model and changed the "runTest" function to allow for multiple power calculations based on 5 different hypotheses.

#??????????????it still doesnt have a way to include effect size in to it. What we have is eta squared values of about .3. Which could be small to medium effect size
#ref: 10.1111/lang.12137. The study exployed approach similar to the present one. However, the it was a within subject design of 2x3x6. On an average it showed an effect size of .3
